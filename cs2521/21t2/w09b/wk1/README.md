# Tutorial 1

## The scripted part
- Why I may not be your tutor this term...
- Quick course overview
- Contacting me
    - My email is `james.davidson@student.unsw.edu.au`
    - If you want me to look at your code, please send as much info as you can
        - Package multi-file programs into a zip file!
        - Also tell me what you've tried so far in terms of debugging, what kind of inputs it works/breaks on, etc. - every bit helps
    - If you have really major queries, direct them to the course account instead: `cs2521@cse.unsw.edu.au`
- What to do before class
    - Try to look at the questions in your own time so that you can find the ones you want me to go over, or any topics
    - Otherwise I'll just go over the questions I think are worthwhile and doable in 1 hour

## The unscripted part
- Brief introductions
- Tute questions!
