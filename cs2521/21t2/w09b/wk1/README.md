# Tutorial 1

## The scripted part
- Quick course overview
    - Take a look at the assessment strategy and make sure you know what you're being marked on, as well as the exam hurdle!
    - We won't be too harsh with marking if there is clear evidence of effort on your part
- Admin regarding this tute
    - My email is `james.davidson@student.unsw.edu.au`
        - I'll try to respond within 24 hours, but make no promises
        - Please consider asking on the forums though for more general questions (e.g. you don't get part of a lab task)
            - Helps other students find answers to their questions quicker
            - Helps tutors too as we only have to answer the question once
    - If you want me to look at your code, please send as much info as you can
        - Package multi-file programs into a zip file! Makes our life a lot easier, which is good for everyone involved
        - Also tell me what you've tried so far in terms of debugging, what kind of inputs it works/breaks on, etc. - every bit helps
    - If you have really major queries (e.g. you need an extension), direct them to the course account instead: `cs2521@cse.unsw.edu.au`
- How I will aim to run tutes
    - Try to look at the questions in your own time so that you can find the ones you want me to go over
    - Otherwise I'll just go over the questions I think are worthwhile and doable in 1 hour
        - Anything I don't cover is left as an exercise
        - Can email if you're unsure about anything though (but again, also consider posting on forums)
    - Also let me know if there are some topics you'd like me to recap!
- How we will aim to run labs
    - Lab `n` is due in week `n+1`, i.e. the week after
    - Post in the chat whenever you're ready to be marked off, and we'll come around
    - If you want to work together with someone in the session, let us know and we'll make a breakout room for you guys

## The unscripted part
- Introductions (via Blackboard text chat)
- Tute questions!
