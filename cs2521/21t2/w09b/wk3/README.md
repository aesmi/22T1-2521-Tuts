# Tutorial 3

## Reminders
- Try not to leave submitting labs to the last day (lol)
- If you have time, check out the [bonus lab on debugging](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2521/21T2/lab/11/questions)!

## The tute
- Anything you want me to go over?
    - Do you find explicit recaps helpful, or would you prefer me to recap as we go?
- Any particular tute question requests?
    - My plan: all analysis questions except q3 and q6
    - If we get time, we'll talk about the `gcc` and Makefiles questions at the end
