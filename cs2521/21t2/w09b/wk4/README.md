# Tutorial 4

## Reminders
- Assignment 1 is now out

## The tute
- As decided, we'll use the tute questions to recap from now on
- We'll try to do at least q1, q2, q3, q5, q7, q8 and q9

## Some nice resources
- [Online BST visualiser](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html)
    - Always good to play around with to view the process happening step-by-step
    - This website also has a good visualisation tool for AVL trees too
- [The Wikipedia article on tree rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_rotation)
    - This has some seriously good images/gifs of the rotation process!
